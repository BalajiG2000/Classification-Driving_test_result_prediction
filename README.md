# Classification-Driving_test_result_prediction

The dataset used for this task is "DMV driving test results dataset". Based on the pass/fail prediction a Driving License will be awarded for the applicants.

I implemented all the machinery, including gradient descent, cost function, and logistic regression, of the various learning algorithms to have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.

I tried  to build a logistic regression model using Python and NumPy, conduct basic exploratory data analysis, and implement gradient descent from scratch.

NOTE:

We can interpret the output of the logistic sigmoid function as a probability, since this function outputs in the range 0 to 1 for any input.
We can threshold the function at 50% to make our classification.
